        <p class="hero-text">With the changing lifestyles of modern people, health has become a significant concern for individuals. 
          People hope to maintain their physical health through proper diet and exercise, and each person's body condition and health needs are different, 
          requiring personalized health training plans. A health training plan application can help users develop personalized health training plans based on their body condition, 
          health needs, and preferences, enabling them to achieve their health goals better. 
          Therefore, our project will implement the OpenAI API to provide users with a customized and interactive experience that is tailored to their unique fitness goals and needs.
